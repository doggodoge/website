    talkDescription:
      "To get the best from computers, there are several things you can do. First, make sure you have a reliable and up-to-date antivirus program installed to protect your computer from viruses and malware. Secondly, keep your computer's operating system, software, and drivers updated to ensure they are running smoothly and efficiently. Thirdly, organize your files and folders to make it easier to find what you need. Fourthly, regularly clean up your computer by deleting temporary files and uninstalling programs you no longer need.

    talkTitle: "How to Get the Best from React",
    talkDescription:
      "React is like a box of Lego blocks for building websites. It's a tool that helps people create web pages by putting together different pieces, just like how you build a Lego house by connecting different bricks. With React, you can create different parts of a website, such as buttons, images, and menus, and then put them all together to make a complete website. It's like playing with Legos, but instead of building a physical toy, you're creating a website that people can see on their computers or phones. React makes it easier to build websites and make them look pretty without having to start from scratch every time.",

    talkTitle: "Why Software Architects that Don't Code Doesn't Work",
    talkDescription:
      "While non-coding software architects may have coding experience, it is still not an ideal approach as they are not directly involved in the implementation process. Software architecture is not just about creating designs but also about ensuring that these designs are practical, efficient, and feasible to implement. Architects who don't code may create designs that are difficult or even impossible to implement in practice. They may also overlook potential issues or challenges that could arise during the implementation phase, leading to longer development cycles and increased costs. Furthermore, by being removed from the implementation process, non-coding architects may not have a deep understanding of the nuances of the codebase, making it difficult to make informed design decisions that take into account the software's constraints and limitations. Therefore, it is generally better for architects to have hands-on experience with coding and software development to create designs that are both practical and effective.",
